Argonot syntax conventions (may be subject to change):

- class names in Camel case: ClassName, QPSolver
- variable and method names with underscores: variable_name, method_name
- private attributes have a "_" suffix: private_attribute_
- attributes and methods are called with a "this->" suffix: this->attribute, this->method()
